## Setup

### 1. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your MQTT broker details:

```bash
MQTT_BROKER=mqtt.meshtastic.org
MQTT_PORT=1883
MQTT_TOPIC=msh/#
MQTT_USERNAME=meshdev
MQTT_PASSWORD=large4cats
MQTT_KEEPALIVE=60
MQTT_CLIENT_ID=meshtastic_dashboard
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

### 3. Initialize with Demo Data (Optional)

To see the dashboard in action with sample data:

```bash
uv run python create_demo_data.py
```

### 4. Start the Dashboard

```bash
uv run python run_dashboard.py
```

The dashboard will be available at http://localhost:5000 (or the port specified by the `PORT` environment variable)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application supports the following environment variables:

- `MQTT_BROKER` - MQTT broker hostname (required)
- `MQTT_USERNAME` - MQTT username (required)  
- `MQTT_PASSWORD` - MQTT password (required)
- `MQTT_TOPIC` - MQTT topic to subscribe to (required)
- `HOST` - Host/IP address to bind the web server to (optional, defaults to 0.0.0.0)
- `PORT` - Port for the web dashboard (optional, defaults to 5000)

You can set the host and port by adding them to your `.env` file:
```
HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=8080
```

Or by setting them when running the application:
```bash
HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=8080 uv run python run_dashboard.py
```

**Note:** Using `HOST=0.0.0.0` (default) binds to all network interfaces, making the dashboard accessible from other devices on your network. Use `HOST=127.0.0.1` or `HOST=localhost` to restrict access to the local machine only.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **MQTT Decoder** (`main.py`): 
   - Connects to Meshtastic MQTT broker
   - Decrypts encrypted packets using AES-CTR
   - Parses all Meshtastic protobuf message types
   - Stores data in SQLite database

2. **Web Backend** (`app.py`):
   - Flask web server with REST API
   - WebSocket support for real-time updates
   - Serves the dashboard frontend

3. **Database** (`database.py`):
   - SQLite schema for nodes, packets, and connections
   - Thread-safe operations
   - Automatic connection tracking

4. **Frontend Architecture**:
   - **Main Dashboard** (`static/js/dashboard.js`): Core application logic and URL management
   - **Map Module** (`static/js/map-view.js`): OpenStreetMap integration and marker management
   - **Graph Module** (`static/js/graph-view.js`): Network graph visualization with vis.js
   - **Stats Module** (`static/js/stats.js`): Real-time statistics and metrics
   - **Modern Responsive UI** (`templates/index.html`): Clean, professional interface

## Usage Tips

### Sharing Node Links
1. Click any node on the map or graph
2. Copy the updated URL from your browser
3. Share the link with others to show them the specific node
4. Recipients will see the dashboard automatically focus on that node

### Understanding Position Quality
- **Green markers**: Confirmed GPS positions (most accurate)
- **Yellow markers**: Triangulated positions (estimated from multiple sources)
- **Red markers**: Estimated positions (least accurate)

### Graph Interactions
- **Hover over nodes**: See detailed hardware and status information
- **Click nodes**: Focus both map and graph on the selected node
- **Hover over edges**: See connection quality and packet statistics
- **Drag nodes**: Rearrange the graph layout manually

## Development

### Adding New Message Types

1. Add decoder logic in `decode_port_payload()` function
2. Update `process_decoded_payload()` for database storage
3. Add frontend handling in the JavaScript code

### Customizing the Map

Edit the map initialization in `templates/index.html`:
```javascript
map = L.map('map').setView([39.4, -8.2], 8); // Set your preferred center and zoom
```

### Database Customization

Modify the schema in `database.py` and update the corresponding frontend code to display new fields.

## Troubleshooting

### MQTT Connection Issues
- Verify broker URL and credentials in `.env`
- Check firewall settings for port 1883/8883
- Ensure topic permissions are correct

### Decryption Problems
- Default key is included for the public Meshtastic network
- For private networks, update the key in `decrypt_payload()`
- Check that the nonce generation matches your network's implementation

### Performance
- The system handles thousands of packets efficiently
- Database auto-cleans old data to prevent bloat
- WebSocket updates are throttled to prevent UI overload
